# recursion

Assignment from The Odin Project:

Use what you have learnt about recursion so far to tackle two classic problems that can leverage recursion: Fibonacci and Merge Sort.

Running project code:

JavaScript files can be run directly from the command line using the node command installed with nodejs.

For example, to run the mergeSort function from the command line, first navigate to the correct folder.

Type "node"

Enter "const { mergeSort, merge } = require("./merge-sort");"

Type "mergeSort(yourArray);" to sort an array.
